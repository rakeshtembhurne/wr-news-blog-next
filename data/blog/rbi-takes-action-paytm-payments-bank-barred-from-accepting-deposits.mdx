**New Delhi, India:** In a significant move, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank, barring it from accepting deposits from customers.

The RBI's decision is **based on a comprehensive system audit report and subsequent compliance validation report** conducted by external auditors. These reports revealed ongoing non-compliances and material supervisory concerns, necessitating further action from the central bank.

Effective February 29, 2024, Paytm Payments Bank will no longer be permitted to accept deposits or engage in credit transactions and top-ups in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, or National Common Mobility Cards (NCMC cards). However, **withdrawals or utilization of balances** by customers from their accounts, including savings bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, and NCMC cards, will be **allowed without restrictions**, up to their available balance.

In March 2022, the RBI had previously directed Paytm Payments Bank to immediately cease onboarding new customers.

## **RBI's Statement on the Paytm Payments Bank Restriction:**

In a statement, the RBI emphasized that the decision to restrict Paytm Payments Bank's deposit-taking activities is **intended to safeguard the interests of depositors** and maintain the financial stability of the banking system. The statement also noted that the bank has failed to address the concerns raised by the RBI despite repeated opportunities.

## **Customer Implications of the Restriction:**

As a result of the RBI's directive, Paytm Payments Bank customers will not be able to deposit funds, add money to their wallets, or top-up their FASTags after February 29, 2024. However, they will still be able to access their existing balances and utilize them for various transactions, subject to the available balance.

## **Industry Reaction to the RBI's Action:**

The RBI's decision has been met with **mixed reactions** from the banking and fintech industry. Some experts have expressed concern over the impact on Paytm Payments Bank's customers and the potential disruption to digital payments. Others have commended the RBI's move, **emphasizing the importance of compliance and prudent risk management** in the banking sector.

## **Paytm Payments Bank's Response:**

Paytm Payments Bank has responded to the RBI's directive by asserting its commitment to addressing the concerns raised by the central bank. The bank has stated that it is **taking necessary steps to strengthen its compliance and risk management systems** to ensure it operates in full compliance with regulatory requirements.

As the situation evolves, it is crucial for Paytm Payments Bank to take prompt and effective action to rectify the compliance issues and address the RBI's concerns. The bank must prioritize the interests of its customers and work towards restoring their confidence in its services.
